PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ADDRESS FOR THE APP:
https://fs-3b-phonebook-backend-v2.onrender.com

- the requests in the folder /requests work (they have the correct app address also).

In GitHub, this is phonebook-backend-v2. This was created so that the backend and frontend would be in different repos, so that there will be no problem with the .git folder making it impossible to open the backend in GitHub (which is dumb)
